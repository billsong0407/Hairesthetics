### Project Details
Date of project start: Sept 16th

This project is a mobile iOS application that allows users to try on different hairstyles virtually, to simplify the decision making process before going into a hair salon. The application will provide a 3D virtual simulation of the selected hairstyle for the user, which means the hairstyle moves as the user moves their head. Our application will also allow the users to change their hair color. Hairesthetics is able to identify user's distinct facial features and give hairstyle recommendations with respect to different facial features.
