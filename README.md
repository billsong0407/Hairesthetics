# HairEsthetics :scissors:
### Project Details
Date of project start: Sept 16th

This project is a web application that allows users to try on different hair styles and hair colors virtually, to simplify the decision making process before going into a hair salon. The application will provide a real-time 3D simulation of the selected hair style and color for the user. The hair styles can rotate, scale, and moves along with the user head movement. Our application also allows the users to upload images and see the hair color changes. Moreover, HairEsthetics provides nearby salon recommendation based on inputted location.
